I’ve always believed that **learning DSA should be about focus, not clutter**. That idea sparked the creation of **Leet Master** — a cleaner, smarter, and faster platform to help developers level up their coding skills with simplicity and elegance.

After months of design, iteration, and building from scratch, I’m proud to finally share it with everyone.

### 🧩 What is Leet Master?

Leet Master is my vision of a **distraction-free DSA practice experience** — one that feels modern, consistent, and intuitive.

It’s not just another problem archive. Every detail was crafted to make the learning journey smoother:

- **Clean, minimal UI** built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS
- **Smart categorization** by difficulty, topics, and company tags
- **Dynamic problem creation system** with editable test cases and examples
- **Multi-language code editor** (Java, JavaScript, C++)
- **Responsive layout** that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile

### 💡 The Idea Behind It

While preparing for coding interviews, I noticed how messy it can get to switch between problem sites, notes, and code editors.  
So, I decided to bring everything together — **a single platform where learners can focus purely on improving their logic**.

Each problem on Leet Master is thoughtfully designed with:

- Clear examples
- Concise constraints
- Real-world test cases
- Company tags for context

No fluff. No ads. Just **clean code and structured practice**.

### 🚀 Built with Precision

Leet Master is powered by:

- **Next.js** for lightning-fast rendering
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** for a scalable backend
- **ShadCN UI components** for consistency
- **React Query** for smooth data flow

Every part of the app was built to be modular, performant, and developer-friendly.

### ❤️ Shared on X and LinkedIn

When I shared Leet Master on [X](https://x.com/coder_nandan/status/1931643563219018214) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codernandan_introducing-leet-master-a-cleaner-smarter-activity-7337410803815391232-8K4b), I was genuinely humbled by the response.

Developers resonated with the idea of a minimal, focused DSA experience — and that means a lot to me.
