  about: `
Hello, World! I am Nandan Manna — a Full-Stack Engineer passionate about building scalable, user-friendly software solutions with clean code and creative UI designs.

With 4+ years of experience, I specialize in developing high-performance web applications using Next.js, React, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern full-stack technologies. Beyond work, I love experimenting with new tools, coding for fun, and turning ideas into real-world products.

I am the founder of [LeetMaster](https://leetmaster.in) — a platform designed to help learners master coding challenges through structured problem sets, playlists, and editorial support.  
I also created [Crazxy UI](https://crazxyui.in) — a collection of modern, reusable UI components that simplify building beautiful interfaces.   

Currently, I’m exploring advanced system designs, scalable architectures, and open-source contributions to push my engineering journey further.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
